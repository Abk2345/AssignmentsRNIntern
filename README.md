# React-Native Projects

This repository lists the code and snapshots of different react-native projects as my personal projects, each project is contained in separate folders with clear-cut names, consisting of their snapshots

# How to set up project locally
1. Set up expo-cli globally in your pc
2. set up react-native for android in your pc
3. clone the repository locally
4. for each project, copy files to either expo or react-native project set up in your device
5. whwther it is expo based or react native based app, depends on the library it is using,
if the library is native based, then react-native setup should be prefered, otherwise expo setup
6. Running of code, checking proper import and filenames

# Hope you enjoyed and learnt something from these projects!
